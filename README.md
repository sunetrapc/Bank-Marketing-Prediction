# Bank Marketing Prediction
## Objective
The goal is to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a bank's marketing offer based on their attributes.
This is a binary classification problem, where the target variable is y (yes or no).
## Key Steps
1. Data Preprocessing:

-Load and clean the data.
-One-hot encode categorical variables (e.g., job, marital status).
-Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. Model Development:

-Build a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras.
-Train the model to predict the target variable (y).

3. Model Evaluation:

-Evaluate the model using a confusion matrix.
-Visualize the modelâ€™s performance and prediction results.

4. Results:

-The pie chart shows the balance between customers who subscribed and those who didn't, with 49.4% saying "Yes" and 50.6% saying "No".
-The model's performance was evaluated, and accuracy was calculated based on predictions on the test dataset.
